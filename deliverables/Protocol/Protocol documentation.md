## Scenarios

### Joining game

![Joining_game](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Joining_game.png)

Client1 is the first client that connects to the Server. The Server notifies Client1 of the successful connection
and asks to provide a username. Client1 provides a username that can be either valid or invalid. Client1 continues
providing new usernames until one is valid. When a valid username is received, the Sever send an ack and asks 
Client1 to provide the game settings. Client1 continues providing new settings until they are valid.
Whenever valid settings are received, the Server notifies Client1 that the game was joined. After that Client2
and Client3 connect to the Server, they are notified of the successful connection and they are asked to provide
a username. They get notified when they join the game. Whenever a client connects, all the other clients get notified.
After the required number of player is reached, the game is started and every client is notified of the initial
game state. Every time a client is asked to provide information, it can provide an abortMessage instead. Whenever
this happens the Server sends a PlayerDisconnectedMessage to every client and shuts down the game (not
reported in the diagram for clarity)

### Planning phase

![Planning_phase](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Planning_phase.png)

The Server fills the clouds with new students and notifies every client of the change. Then, Client1 is asked to 
select a helper card by performing a move in a certain amount of time. If the submitted move is invalid and the time
has not expired yet, the client can submit a new one. Once the time is up, the move is chosen randomly if invalid or 
not received by the Server. After the move has been chosen, the Server updates the game and notifies all the clients.
After that, every other client is asked to select a helper the same way (not reported in the diagram for brevity)

### Action phase: moving students

![Action_phase_1](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Action_phase_1.png)

Client1 is asked to position 3 of the students in its school entrance either on an island or in its school by performing
3 different moves, each in a certain amount of time. If any of the submitted moves is invalid and the time has not expired
yet, the client can submit a new one. Once the time is up, the move is chosen randomly if invalid or not received by the 
Server. After the move has been chosen, the Server updates the game and notifies all the clients. 

### Action phase: moving mother nature

![Action_phase_2](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Action_phase_2.png)

Client1 is asked to move mother nature by performing a move in a certain amount of time. If the submitted move is invalid 
and the time has not expired yet, the client can submit a new one. Once the time is up, the move is chosen randomly if 
invalid or not received by the Server. After the move has been chosen, the Server updates the game and notifies all the 
clients. 

### Action phase: choosing clouds

![Action_phase_3](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Action_phase_3.png)

Client1 is asked to choose a cloud by performing a move in a certain amount of time. If the submitted move is invalid
and the time has not expired yet, the client can submit a new one. Once the time is up, the move is chosen randomly if
invalid or not received by the Server. After the move has been chosen, the Server updates the game and notifies all the
clients. 

### Game ending

![Game_ending](sequencediagram.org%20code/Initial%20Protocol/Game_ending.png)

Whenever the Server updates the game and acknowledges the game ending, the last update is sent to every client and subsequently
every client is notified of the game ending.
